I am currently pursuing an Honours Bachelor of Technology degree in Informatics and Security at Seneca College.
My tech journey began with Java programming for my highschool computer science classes. From there, I learned about
computer hardware basics through private classes. So far studying at Seneca, I have learned networking, Linux system administration,
C programming, computer forensics, reverse engineering, database administration, penetration testing, and so much more. In my free time
I enjoy practicing these skills and tinkering around with my own personal tech projects, this blog is dedicated to demonstrating some of
those projects.
