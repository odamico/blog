# Hello world!

### Welcome to my new GitHub Pages blog

This site was generated using Hugo, a fast and simple framework for building static webpages.
Hugo works nicely with GitHub pages for hosting simple web content. I hope to post personal projects and guides
related to information security, programming, game development, data science, and more!
